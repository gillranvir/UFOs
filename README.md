## Summary
#
### 1. The filters should also provide a drop down list from which a selection can be made for any of the parameters. Otherwise, one might be forced to glance through the table first and then apply search criteria. 
#
### 2. The entire table need not be published on the webpage. The table can be contained within a scrollable window that helps make the webpage concise.
